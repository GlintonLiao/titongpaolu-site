<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Architectural industry has become a nightmare for its low pay and regularly overwork. However, architectural students might have no awareness about the actual working environment, still holding an idealism expectation on this major, a major that is considered to be "art".

The name of this project "TITONGPAOLU", stands for a chinese word “提桶跑路”, which means a worker, carring his/her bucket, and runs away from the construction site.

The materials for this page are from various social media platforms, dedicating to telling people, **do not enter the architectural industry**.

## Project Structure

+ Front-end: 
  + React.js
  + Tailwind CSS
+ Back-end: 
  + next.js
  + notion database and API
  
## Key Concept

### Static Site Generation (SSG)

### `useContext()`

## Key Point

1. in api/xxx.js, the handler function should be "export **default** async function handler"

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
